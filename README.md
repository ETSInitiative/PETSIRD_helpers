# PETSIRD helpers and examples

This is a placeholder to reserve some names for moving the PETSIRD helpers
currently in https://github.com/ETSInitiative/PETSIRD to a separate repo.

## Background

The [Emission Tomography Standardization Initiative (ETSI)](https://etsinitiative.org/)
is working towards establishing a standard for PET Raw Data, called PETSIRD ("PET ETSI Raw Data").
